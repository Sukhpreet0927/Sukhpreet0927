I'm a developer who loves turning ideas into reality through code. Whether I'm optimizing student tools, diving into React Native, or experimenting with AI, I bring curiosity, creativity, and a drive to learn into every project.

This summer, I’m also joining **Fast Enterprises** as a **Software Implementation Consultant**, where I’ll be solving real client problems while continuing my research efforts on the side — because learning never stops.
Always excited to collaborate, build, and grow. Let’s connect!
