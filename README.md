# 👋 Hi, I'm Sukhpreet!

I recently graduated with a Computer Science Degree at UC Davis with a minor in Middle Eastern and South Asian Studies. 

I'm a developer who loves turning ideas into reality through code. Whether I'm optimizing student tools, diving into React Native, or experimenting with AI, I bring curiosity, creativity, and a drive to learn into every project.
I’m especially passionate about **mobile development**, building intuitive apps that create real-world impact. I’m currently contributing to an **open-source research initiative** where we're developing a mobile app designed to .
This summer, I’m also joining **Fast Enterprises** as a **Software Implementation Consultant**, where I’ll be solving real client problems while continuing my research efforts on the side — because learning never stops.
Always excited to collaborate, build, and grow. Let’s connect!
